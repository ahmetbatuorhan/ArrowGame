# ArrowGame
Bilkent University CS223 (Digital Design and Computer Architecture) Term Project / System Verilog

This program was coded by using System Verilog. Also, Beti Board and Basys3 FPGA was used. In this basic game, if the user's input's direction is the same as with the arrow's direction that appeared in RGB 8x8 Led Matrix, userâ€™s score is incremented by the program. Also, the user can arrange the game's speed by using the switches which were located at the Beti Board.

For anything, please directly connect with me. It will be a pleasure to help you!
